            <div class="introduction">
                        <p>
                         <img src="/images/placeholda-avatar.png" alt="Avatar" style="width:128px;height:128px;" ALIGN=”left”> 
                                    This is a bunch of placeholder text.
                                    Nevermind it, I'm going to replace it soon enough with information about me. I just want to test this layout first
                                    and make sure it's doing everything I want to. So please enjoy this rambling as I fill up space. I don't know what
                                    to say, really, but it's filling up the page, so that's pretty awesome. Eventually there will be some great content
                                    here and I'm pretty excited to have that done! But thse things take time, so check back eventually. Test.
                        </p>
            </div>
